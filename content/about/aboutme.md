# It all began in...

*2002*, « Resident evil » came out, and with it, me. 20 years later, I'm building a blog to talk about myself, peak people's interest and try to know myself better (Also I kinda want to test my web skills.). I live in [France] and I study in *Math and IT*. I'm part of a student organisation called [{rootmim}](https://rootmim.org) consecrating itself in order to teach UL's student penetration-testing and other valuable knowledge.

# Things that inspire me

I listen to a shit ton of music, and I also play a shit ton of old video games when I feel like it; here's a few example

- * ACE COMBAT
- * KILLER 7 
- * SILENT HILL
- * ICO

Here, a few of my favorites. 
I'm also greatly inspired by people in the Intelligence field and some instances of journalists. Chelsea Manning and Julien Assange (to once again only name a few...). They've done good to this world, and that's someone I aspire to be, to help people and inspire more generations to come.

# Contacts

I don't think I want to say more about myself yet, but feel free to contact me at some random email I found in the bin : 
[mxreich.contact@gmail.com](mailto:mxreich.contact@gmail.com)

I've got nothing more to talk about, lol.
