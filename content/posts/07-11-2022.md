# Welcome

Greetings,
My name's **Maximilien REICHERT**, I'm an IT Student at Universit√© de Lorraine and this is my own blog. I'm currently 20 (and hoping the site releases before I get to be 21), vice-president in communication at **[{rootmim}](https://rootmim.org/)**. I'll try to update this blog as much as I can as the years go by, but can't promise anything. This morning, someone showed me *Hugo* and now here you are. This blog will contain some of my **college works and projects**. I will try to also put my personal interests and hobbies, but don't expect much. Anyway, That's it for the first small and introductory post, I'll make another one soon containing links to my github projects.

Cya
